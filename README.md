# Eye Direction Detector for mobile devices

## Abstract
Precise prediction of eyes' movement have become important in CV, meanwhile there are more and more HCI projects are devoted into this realm. However, the appearance-based modle is not quite robust in respond to changeable light and environments. As a result, we are please to introduce a computational process to deal with this problem.

We came upon this project due to the inconvenience of using smart phones in certain situations. E.g. people need to take off gloves to use their smart phone in winter or their hands are busy but need to use the cellphone. Actually, other body gestures like eye movements can also cast a command and people can enjoy hands-free operations.

There are two main kinds of ways to detect eye movement which are Model-based detection and Appearance-based detection. Model-based process requires instruments such as high-resolution infrared cameras which are usually not installed on cellphones. Considering Appearance-based model, there are more and more researches on CNNs and some showed the results were acceptable. Still, Appearance-models are sensitive to the change of pixel values, which makes the detection hard and inefficient and cannot put into practice.
